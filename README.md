# Countdown Timer Program

Welcome to the **Countdown Timer Program**! This is a simple, command-line-based countdown timer built with Python. It allows you to set a timer, and it will count down to zero, providing real-time feedback and a completion message.

This project was built to practice working with:
- Python's time module.
- Terminal-based user input/output.
- Basic loops and control flow.

## Features

- Set a countdown time in minutes and seconds.
- See the remaining time as the countdown progresses.
- Display a message when the countdown is complete.

## How it works:

1. **Start Timer:**  
   Enter the time you want to count down from in minutes and seconds. The program will show the time remaining and update it every second.
   
2. **Completion:**  
   When the timer reaches zero, a message is displayed indicating that the countdown has completed.

3. **Exit:**  
   You can exit the timer anytime during the countdown by pressing Ctrl+C or closing the terminal.
